# Welcome to the UM DCMB BIOINF 575 class repo!
This site will house any of the code that the instructors develop during the course. 
Additionally, students are free to submit questions, answer questions, or submit their own
code here as well.

**Note**: Whenever you see `<SOMETHING>`, it means to replace the `<SOMETHING>` with what you want. For example:
```bash
# Original
cp <TARGET> <DESTINATION>
# Modified
cp dcmb/foo.py working_dir/
```

### Updating your local repo
As we work on code throughout this class, you will be expected to use code stored in this repo. However, because you will be changing the code as we go through it, you will eventually get an error when you `git pull` (or update) the repo that says something like "Your local changes to the following files will be overwritten by merge’". 

When you get to this issue, please read the [wiki](https://github.com/dcmb-courses/bioinf575/wiki/Updating-your-local-repo) page that details how to update your local repo without overwritting your data. This _should_ become habit before class starts.

To find out more about `git stash`, go to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing to read all about it.
