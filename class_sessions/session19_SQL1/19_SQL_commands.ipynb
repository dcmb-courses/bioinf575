    "#### Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n",
    "* Software programs such as Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, DB2, postgreSQL, SQLite \n",
    "* They handle the data storage, indexing, logging, tracking and security (access)  \n",
    "* They have a very fine-grained way of granting permissions to users at the level of commands that may be used\n",
    "    * Create a database\n",
    "    * Create a table\n",
    "    * Update or insert data\n",
    "    * View certain tables ... and many more   \n",
    "* An important part of learning databases is to understand the type of data which is stored in columns and rows.  \n",
    "* Likewise when we get to the database design section, it is critically important to know what type of data you will be modeling and storing (and roughly how much, in traditional systems) \n",
    "* Exactly which types are available depends on the database system\n",

    "#### Why use databases and Relational Database Management Systems?\n",
    "* Easy, efficient, secure, collaborative management of data that maintains data integrity\n",

    "#### What is the Structured Query Language (SQL) ?\n",
    "* SQL is the standard language for relational database management systems\n",
    "* SQL is used to communicate with a database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why SQLite?\n",
    "SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. \n",
    "* SQLite is often the technology of choice for small applications, particularly those of embedded systems and devices like phones and tablets, smart appliances, and instruments.\n",
    "* It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have a `Connection`, you can create a `Cursor` object and call its execute() method to perform SQL commands.\n",
